## Hi there, I'm Shashi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a first-year student at PESU pursuing B.Tech in CSE and I am really excited to dive into the world of programming and technology.  
I intend to develop a strong foundation in coding while also exploring new concepts, building projects, and especially collaborating with others.  
Let's connect and make something amazing together! ðŸš€
